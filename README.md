Polkahub is a fast, scalable cloud infrastructure for Substrate parachains, a
"Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for Substrate Nodes". Inspired by Heroku
[https://heroku.com], it aims to create a managed container system.
The proposed system enables automatic updates and resource management for
running nodes, provides parachain-launching templates. It provides parachain
developers with the ability to launch and manage network infrastructure using our command
line utility - and the ability to provide public node access. In addition, it offers a uniform
standard for packaging and deploying applications to cloud infrastructure.
